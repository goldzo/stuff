          >Hello! I'm Gold, an intermediate developer passionate about creating
          meaningful digital experiences. With a year of coding under my belt,
          I've delved into various programming languages and realms of
          development. JavaScript and Python are my mainstays, but I also dabble
          in GDScript for game development.</em

        <em
          >Speaking of games, my journey into programming began with the allure
          of game development. I've explored Lua for Roblox game creation,
          sparking my interest in scripting and problem-solving within virtual
          worlds.</em

      <p>
        <em
          >Beyond games, I've ventured into the realm of Discord bot
          development, wielding my skills in JavaScript, Python, and even
          exploring Bot Designer for Discord (BDFD). Crafting bots to streamline
          tasks and enhance Discord communities has been an exciting facet of my
          coding journey.</em

        <em
          >While my expertise lies in these areas, I'm also familiar with web
          development, crafting simple yet effective web pages. As an
          intermediate developer, I'm continuously seeking opportunities to
          learn and grow, eager to tackle new challenges and expand my skill
          set.</em
